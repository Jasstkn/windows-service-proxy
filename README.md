# windows-service-proxy

Home for an out of tree Windows kube-proxy implementation based on KPNG.

# Testing

We're in the process of building development tooling, but for now... 

- The hack directory can build and compile this as a windows container.  
- Then you can run the recipes in the `deploy/` directory
